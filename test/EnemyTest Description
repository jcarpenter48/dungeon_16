EnemyTest contians 2 seperate JunitsTests to test the Enemy class used in the Dungeon game
The first Junits test ensures that enemies can sucessfully take damage and have their HP lowered. This test allows for the room class to delete
enemies once their hp sucessfully reaches 0 or lower
The second Junits test tests the damage dealt by enemies ensuring that damage is correctly returned based on value instantiated by the constructor
for calculating player damage
