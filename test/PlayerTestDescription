PlayerTest initializes a player object to test the Player class which is a core class for the dungeon game.
The PlayerTest checks to ensure that on construction, player hp, current hp, and weapons are clearly and accurately instantiated and
that player coordinates can be acccurately controlled within a room's 2D array of RoomTiles.
